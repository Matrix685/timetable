                    This project started in January of 2025 as an alternative to the assignment the rest of the class received: an algorithm to create exam schedules.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    We initially planned to create the timetable using Python, specifically the tkinter module, in order that we might store the completed product as an 
                executable file. However, this proved impractical due to our lack of understanding of the module's operations. Therefore, we decided to create a webpage for 
                the project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    We first put together the timetable's grid format on the 29th of January, and within the next week we created the first algorithm to control the placement
                    of exams on the timetable; three subjects, English, Irish and Maths, were placed randomly on the table. As well as that, by the 4th of February we had added
                    a menu which allowed the user to change the content of any cell in the timetable in case our rudimentary algorithm had arranged the exams unsuitably.
