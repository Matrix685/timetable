                <p class="paragraph">This project started in January of 2025 as an alternative to the assignment the rest of the class received: an algorithm to create exam schedules.</p>

                        We initially planned to create the timetable using Python, specifically the tkinter module, in order that we might store the completed product as an executable file. However,
                        after brief experimentation, this proved impractical due to our lack of understanding of the module's operations. Therefore, we decided to create a webpage for the project
                        using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

                    <!-- tkinter image here? -->
                    <img />
                    <!-- timetable from 29/1/25 -->

                    <p class="paragraph right">
                        We began to construct the timetable on the 29th of January, creating a gridded format using HTML and CSS and adding predetermined placeholder text to a few cells using
                        JavaScript. We also added a series of dropdown menus that would allow the user to overwrite a given location on the timetable with a typed string. On the 4th of February, we
                        wrote an algorithm that would generate simple timetables by placing three subjects-- English, Irish and Maths-- in randomised cells of the grid.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The next day, we began to build an alternative method for changing the content of a cell; draggable tiles labelled for subjects which, if dragged onto a cell, would overwrite
                        that cell's content with their own. However, this part of the project would go unfinished for a long time.

                    <!-- timetable as of 26/3/25 -->

                    <p class="paragraph right">
                        On February 11th, we expanded the randomisation algorithm to add a random one of three rooms-- Room 5, Room 9 or the
                        <i>Seomra Mór</i> underneath each subject on the timetable. On the 12th, we added many more subjects and split them into two categories: <i>príomha</i>, containing English,
                        Irish, Maths and German/French; and <i>roghnach</i>, containing Woodwork, Metalwork, Home Economics, Art, Technical Graphics, Business, Physics, Chemistry and Biology. We added
                        more rooms along with them; we added all the numbered rooms from one to fourteen that weren't already in the system as well as the <i>Bialann</i>. Over the next while, we made
                        relatively minor changes, such as adding a few missing rooms and fixing the grid so that its columns would remain aligned even when the window was resized.

                    On the 27th of March, we met with Ruth Ní Mhuirí, who is in charge of designing the real exam timetables, to discuss the considerations that go into creating timetables that are
                    actually usable rather than randomly generated. We learned that most years' timetables are constructed differently, and that for the First Year classes we should schedule exams at
                    the same time an in the same room as that subject would usually take place, meaning that we would need to add a way to input the regular class timetable, and that all Second Year
                    exams take place either in the <i>Seomra Mór</i> or <i>Bialann</i>. Armed with this new direction, we continued to work on our program.

                        On April 2nd, we changed the random subject placement algorithm so that it would avoid placing exams in the fifth or sixth period on Wednesday to account for the half day on
                        Wednesdays. On the 8th, we created a popup that would appear after clicking on a cell that would allow the user to manually change the subject and room in that cell, and, since
                        it was now obsolete, we removed the old dropdown that served the same purpose.
